MVP is for devise (the wise)


After Sinatra the introduction & integration of concepts that coincided with Rails was not what I would normally call difficult. The MVC model, building Apps through a gem that’s inherently RESTful? And even the logic being in ruby created a learning environment that was guaranteed to be a smooth and easy transition.

The problem I had though came with the unbeknownst ignoring of my cohort lead. She cautioned to stick to MVP the most viable product that I could put out, hitting the project criteria and not completely stressing myself out. Unfortunately I didn’t heed to the wise and instead turned to a gem called devise. 

Devise is an amazing gem to say the least it feels tantamount to scaffolding except you really have to be sound on your app building processes. Personally I’d recommend not utilizing it until you’ve built your first few apps but unfortunately bind sight is 20/20. Devise comes with custom views and a whole sleuth of methods that are fun to play with; creating very 3Dimensional user models with everything from tracks or attributes to admin accounts and a whole host of password resetting& authentication tools. Pronto though is for a beginner on rails all these toys consume your time and cause you to get lost in the shuffle of building your app. I had to go back to square one and was practically on my own for integrating Omniauth with my app because Devise has its own dependencies, scopes and methods for Omniauth. But in the end I can honestly say it was worth the learning experience and though I wasn’t able to style how I wanted. Next time I’ll head the warning of my Cohort Leads and stick to hitting all the requirements first. Present a working application and THEN ADD the bells in whistles.
