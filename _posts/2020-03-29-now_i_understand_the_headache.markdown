Persistance induced migraine's aren't the best #method

# CLI Project Start

I always knew what I wanted my CLI project to be. I saw my Cohort Lead's instructional video and knew that I wanted to portray my current emotions. With the "Stay-at-home" orders initiated for us in Texas and me working currently at a hospital, I knew it was probably only a matter of time before I would have to be stuck at home with nothing to do except my FLATIRON lessons. Don't get me wrong I love my lessons, but to break up the "rage-quitting" that comes along with constantly typing "learn" into the IDE and then realizing you forgot an `end` . I needed some stress relief other than walking my dog. SO currently I'm waiting for one of my favoirte video game remakes to come out & a whole list of other games that will soon drop this year. What better subject to throw at my coding life than a video game release tracker?

# One - on - One
I had figured out the basics of what i wanted to do but couldn't for the life of me find and API. At least one that suited the needs that I had. It need to show each game (of course) along with a release date included in the hash. Unfortunately the closest thing I could find was one that only had old video games from old systems. Luckily my Cohort Lead confirmed my suspicions that Scraping might be my only alternative to get the information for the project I wanted. 

# After a few days
Cut to the next few days where I went through website after website, utilizing every method necessary to try to find a better page than the one I had from Tech Radar. I fought with multiple lines of code and I think by pure luck was able to finally get my VideoGame class to iterate correctly and split at the correct "long" dash... which is apparenlty different than a normal "-" .Needless to say I had to stick it out & am glad for the experience. I finished my scraping and finished my project but my word it was tiresome. Next time I'm going for an API for sure!
