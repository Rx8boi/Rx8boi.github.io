###  I have to start off by saying the Sinatra Project build really showed me what it means to be a software developer. From the onset I didn't know what to expect with the amount of information we learned in this module, but I can honestly say that I'm a better programmer than when I started the project to where I finished. 

# Starting out
### Like most of the Cohort Leads say throughout the program, pick a subject matter that means alot to you. For my first project I stuck to my first love: video games, this time though I leaned into what I always stay in the loop of: Comic Book Movies. I routinely look at the spoilers & leaks of new movies but unfortunately to those around me I am too knowledgable about the characters while they are barely realizing some heroes have alter egos.  

### ENTER my "MARVEL MOVIE HELPER" a webapp designed for the user's journey into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). I thought about how each persone needed to build their own releationship with the Heroes through each movie. The user can add a movie for each hero and put their own notes down on what they went through, their "hero's journey" so-to-speak. 

## The Frustrating part
### For the most part everything went smoothly I have a gorgeous looking layout and lovely css & html to style the pages. But when i tried to add new Heroes I kept getting erros. This is a lesson to all of you that read my blog. Be sure to ONLY put in what is necessary in your code, alot of fluff from labs that I saw that I didn't know would impact the seeding of my migration tables added a good hour plus of extra work in the late night hours that I didn't need. 

## Other keys to mention:
*  Properly name your migrations
* Remember your directory and how your files are placed in them
* pry is your best friend
* So is Tux especially if youre using sinatra
* Take breaks when you're frustrated youll come back coding better
* If you're frustrated move to styling it'll calm you down


## After-math
### Time can only tell how well I do on my app review. But i'm proud of the learning experience. I switched to a completely local environment, learned how to push & commit to gitHUB properly and gained new insitte on relationships, the MVC model and CRUD. Now I have two great frames of reference when people talk about sinatra!
