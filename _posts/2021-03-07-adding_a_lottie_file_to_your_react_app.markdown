If you're looking to spice up your portfolio project with another component or two in React why not try integrating a lottie file or two into your application? What's that? Never heard of lottie files? Well neither did I until I started looking into splash pages for my application. When it comes to React Native applications I don't know many other animations as efficient as LottieFiles. Lottie files are lightweight, scalable interative animations all in a `.json` file. Crazy right? You can create them yourselves or head to  [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/) and go through a few free ones and add them to your project like I did. 

Now to the fun part... 

Most of the docs tend to focus on utilizing React Native and mobile applications, but with abit of React no-how you can easily add a few to your application like i did.

## 1st Things 1st
So lets start by adding a file to the Intro page.
Download the lottie.json file you want to use and add it to your assets folder (however you have your React-app organized).

- Next we're going to install lottie-web so we can use the .json animations.
Head to your terminal and in the application folder run `npm install lottie-web`

- Once thats done lets move to your text editor for your application & create a new `Thinker.js` file (or whatever the animation is in your application) to start adding the component.

We're going to start by importing lottie (that we just installed) as well as the Effect hook

```
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import lottie from "lottie-web";
```

The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components:

and since this is a functional component and we're using ES6 we're going to set 'Thinker' & 'Container' variables to export and later call in our div.

```
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import lottie from "lottie-web";

const Thinker = () => {
  const container = useRef(null);

```

Next we'll have useEffect the first argument being a function & the second an empty array.

```
useEffect(() => {
    lottie.loadAnimation({
      container: container.current,   //where the element will exist in the DOM
      renderer: "svg",
      loop: true, //set to true if you want it to continuously play
      autoplay: true,
      animationData: require("../../assets/37478-intelligence-ai.json"), //set to where your animation is located
    });
  }, []);
```

Now for the rest of the thinker Component will have the return statement with the div className set to the container class which will have a reference to the variable container.

```
  return (
    <div>
      <div className="container" ref={container}></div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Thinker;
```

Once that's set all thats left is to import the component into the Intro page and we'll be good to go!


## Wrapping it up
Go back to `Intro.js` and we'll import the component like usual & place the self closing `<Thinker />` tags where you want the Lottie file to be:

```
import React from "react";
import Thinker from "../components/lottie/Thinker";
import Container from "react-bootstrap/Container";
import Row from "react-bootstrap/Row";
import Col from "react-bootstrap/Col";

const Intro = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <br></br>
      <Container> 
        <Row>
          <Col>
            <Thinker /> // I placed mine in a column beside the paragraphs
          </Col>
          <Col>
            <h1>Welcome To TimeLine App</h1>
```

Once that's done save your files & run `npm start` and see make sure everythings working!
If yes then you're good to go like me!
